  When working with sinusodial signals like the ones you can find in our current electricity distribution system, it is much easier to work with complex numbers like a+bj where, j^2 = -1. This is called the rectangular form of the complex number. In this way, numbers a and b mean the coordinates of the complex number on the Real and Imaginary axis, respectively. In some cases it is advantageous to convert this form to the so called polar coordinates form where the important things are magnitude (size of the vector in the complex plane) and phase angle(the angle the vector holds with the Real axis). Complex numbers in the polar form are called phasors.

  Your task will be to create a class representing the phasor. It must be possible to instantiate instances of this class using either rectangular or polar coordinates and convert between the two. Then you will have to implement the basic arithmetics of phasors - addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. This class could then be applied for example to an automatic solver of AC circuits.
